# 04 - Array Cardio
Manipulate JavaScript Arrays and Objects

## Changes made from original:
Not really.

## Things I learned:
- `console.table()` to print data as a table in the console
- Some methods
- Some more ways to reduce functions
- The logic behind how `sort()` works
- You can "destructure" a value by assigning it to a array like `[last, first]`
