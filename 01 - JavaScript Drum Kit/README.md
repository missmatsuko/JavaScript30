# 01 - JavaScript Drum Kit

## Changes made from original:
- [x] Modify file structure so that it's a bit more organized
- [x] Modify markup so that drum/key divs are buttons
- [ ] Modify styles so that highlighted styles are applied to the :active or :focus pseudo-selector instead of a 'playing' class
- [ ] Enable clicking and tabbing/entering to play sounds as well
