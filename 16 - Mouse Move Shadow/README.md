# 16 - Mouse Shadow
Manipulate visual effects by mouse movement.

## Changes made from original:
- [x] Modify file structure so that it's a bit more organized
- [x] Use page(X/Y) instead of offsetting offset(X/Y) depending on the event target element
- [x] Change 'walk' variable name to 'spread' - seems more intuitive to me

## Things I learned:
- setting variables by destructuring
- differences between screen(X/Y), offset(X/Y), page(X/Y), and client(X/Y)
