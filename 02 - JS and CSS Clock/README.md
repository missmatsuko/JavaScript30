# 02 - JS + CSS Clock
Functional analog clock.

## Changes made from original:
- [x] Modify file structure so that it's a bit more organized
- [ ] Style clock hands so they can be visually differentiated without waiting for hands to move
- [ ] Style clock so it has numbers and lines?
- [ ] Make JS variable names more consistent (i.e. plural and singular)
- [ ] Adjust the styling instead of adding 90(deg) in JS
- [ ] Fix "jump" in animation when hand gets to 12 o'clock
