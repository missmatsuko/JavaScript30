# 15 - LocalStorage
An checklist that preserves its items in localStorage.

## Changes made from original:
- [x] Modify file structure so that it's a bit more organized
- [ ] Use `data-index` or `id`, don't need both
- [x] Check `e.target.type` instead of checking if `e.target` contains a string with `matches()`
- [x] Remove unnecessary call to `populateList()` in `toggleDone()`
- [ ] Add functionality to remove checklist items

## Things I learned:
- If the object key and value have the same name, you can just put the name of the variable (in ES6)
- Reset method of forms
