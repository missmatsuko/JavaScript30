# 05 - Flex Panels
Interactive image and text gallery.

## Changes made from original:
- [x] Modify file structure so that it's a bit more organized
- [x] Reduce amount of CSS and JS from original
- [x] Move layered transition effect into CSS instead of JS

## Things I learned:
- Calling a function in the event listener apparently makes it run on document load
- Review transition property syntax
