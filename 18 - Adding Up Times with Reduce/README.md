# 18 - Adding up Times with Reduce
Use the reduce method to add up formatted durations.

## Changes made from original:

- [x] Remove last modulus operator on secondsLeft - which actually made the calculation for seconds incorrect
- [x] Change timestamp to seconds calculation to a single reduce (suggested in video)

## Things I learned:
- More about map and reduce
