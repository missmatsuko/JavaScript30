# 06 - Type Ahead
Text input with predictive text.

## Changes made from original:
- [x] Modify file structure so that it's a bit more organized
- [x] Clean up CSS (remove unnecessary CSS)
- [ ] Try using `includes()` instead of `match()` ~~Changed my mind because regex is probably better to use, especially for wrapping the search term with a span.~~ Changed my mind again cuz Bart said user could input regular expressions into the input field.
- [x] Clean up JS a bit

## Things I learned:
Not much new?
