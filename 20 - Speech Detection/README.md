# 20 - Speech Detection
Transcribe speech.

## Changes made from original:
- [x] Modify file structure so that it's a bit more organized
- [x] Pull `result[0]` into its own variable for re-use.

## Things I learned:
- There is native speech detection in JS, without needing any external libraries (although it's currently only available on Chrome and mobile Firefox)
- How to use the speech detection feature
