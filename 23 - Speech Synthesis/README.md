# 23 - Speech Synthesis

## Changes made from original:
- [x] Modify file structure so that it's a bit more organized
- [ ] Figure out why selecting a Google voice makes the select reset to the first option (Chrome)
- [x] Make speech start only when clicking speak button (not on settings changing)

## Things I learned:
- There's native speech synthesis functionality in browsers, and it's supported by most modern browsers.
- How to use the `SpeechSynthesis` API
- That foreign voices will still read English, with an accent. I expected it to just be really buggy/bad.
